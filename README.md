  # 1. Introduction
Welcome to the Online Payment Detection Readme. This document provides an overview of the analysis conducted on Online Payment Detection,Online extortion has become a predominant issue in today's advanced age. With the expanding dependence on innovation and the web for different exchanges,hoodlums have found modern and advanced ways to misdirect and dupe clueless people and businesses. The result is required for successful extortion discovery frameworks has ended up more vital than ever some time recently. One such structure has risen as effective apparatus in combating online extortion is online extortion detection
# 2. Data Summary
The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset that includes various aspects of online payment. The dataset covers the following key areas:

- step: represents a unit of time where 1 step equals 1 hour 
- type: type of online transaction inlcuding PAYMENT,TRANSFER,CASH_OUT,CASH_IN and DEBIT
- amount: the amount of the transaction 
- nameOrig: customer starting the transaction 
- oldbalanceOrg: balance before the transaction 
- newbalanceOrig: balance after the transaction 
- nameDest: recipient of the transaction 
- oldbalanceDest: initial balance of recipient before the transaction 
- newbalanceDest: the new balance of the recipient after the transaction 
- isFraud: fraud transaction 0 meaning normal transaction and 1 meaning fraudulent transaction
# 3. Methodologies
The methodologies include the algorithm used,dataset used and flowchart of the data used and implemented. Below is the provided step by step explanation of the algorithm used.
- Algorithm Used: The decision tree algorithm is a widely used supervised learning technique employed for both classification and regression tasks. It constructs a
structured model resembling a flowchart, driven by input features
- Import necessary libraries and module: from sklearn.tree import Decision tree classifier, import pandas as pd and few other libraries are imported.
- Read the dataset: use necessary commands to read the dataset provided and collect the information from it.
- Preprocess the data: here the data collected is preprocessed so that feature extraction can take place easily.
- Load the data: The data pre-processed now will be loaded into the training model to train the model properly.
- Splitting the data: The data is splitted into training and testing data in proportion of 80:20 out of 100.
- It checks for the target
- Checks for target data: 
- Training model: 4 training model was applied which are decision tree,support vector machine,K-nearest neighbour,logistic regression and decision happened to be the best performing model
- Testing data: after training the model is tested andaccuracy is obtained with necessary graphs. A small comparison plot is also included in algorithm.
- Results: as last step the results are obtained, and the model execution ends. Few additional steps of regularization imputation and many other commands are included in the code to improve the accuracy and prevent the model from overfitting and underfitting. This also increases the generalization of the model and allows it to predict the new data with more accuracy.
# 4. Key Findings
Based on the analysis of the provided data, here are the key findings:

- In the dataset, there are five transaction types: CASH_OUT, PAYMENT, CASH_IN, TRANSFER, and DEBIT. The most prevalent transactions are CASH_OUT and PAYMENT, totaling 373,641 and 353,873 transactions, respectively. CASH_IN transactions are also common, though less frequent than CASH_OUT and PAYMENT, with a count of 227,130. TRANSFER and DEBIT transactions are comparatively less frequent, with counts of 86,753 and 7,178, respectively.

- The analysis of transaction types versus fraud reveals that the majority of transactions involve Transfer, followed by Cash-out, Payment, and debit. Interestingly, fraudulent activities are predominantly associated with cash_out, with 578 instances, followed closely by Transfer with 564 instances. Notably, debit, payment, and cash-in transactions show no recorded instances of fraud,so more attension should be given to transaction type Cah-out and transfer.

- The average transaction amount for non-fraudulent transactions appears to be around 161,601 units.The average transaction amount for fraudulent transactions appears to be substantially higher, around 1,192,628 units. so transaction of amount above 161,601 carried out under the cash-out and transfer option should required effective verification.


# 5. Business Recommendations
Here are the comprehensive business recommendations based on the key findings:

- Focus on Fraud Detection for Cash-Out and Transfer Transactions: Given that fraudulent activities are predominantly associated with cash-out and transfer transactions, it's essential to prioritize fraud detection and prevention measures specifically for these transaction types. Implementing advanced monitoring systems and algorithms tailored to detect suspicious activities in cash-out and transfer transactions can help mitigate fraud risk.


- Enhance Verification Procedures for High-Value Transactions: Since fraudulent transactions tend to involve substantially higher amounts compared to non-fraudulent transactions, consider implementing more stringent verification procedures for transactions above the average transaction amount of 161,601 units, especially for cash-out and transfer transactions. This could include additional authentication steps, such as multi-factor authentication or manual review for high-value transactions.

- Continuous Monitoring and Analysis: Implement a proactive approach to fraud detection by continuously monitoring transaction data and analyzing patterns and anomalies. Utilize advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms to identify potential fraudulent activities in real-time or near-real-time, allowing for swift intervention and mitigation.

- Educate Customers and Employees: Educate customers and employees about common fraud schemes and warning signs to help them identify and report suspicious activities promptly. Encourage customers to regularly review their transaction history for any unauthorized or unusual transactions and provide them with channels to report any concerns or suspicions.

Regularly Update Fraud Prevention Measures: Stay updated with the latest fraud trends, technologies, and regulatory requirements. Regularly review and update fraud prevention policies, procedures, and systems to adapt to evolving fraud threats and ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.

By implementing these recommendations, businesses can strengthen their fraud prevention efforts and reduce the risk of financial losses associated with fraudulent transactions, particularly those involving cash-out and transfer transactions.
